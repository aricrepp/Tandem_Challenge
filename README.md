## The Challenge
Your goal is to create an application that displays trivia questions with multiple choice answers to select from.
Use creative license in terms of how you want us to see this game. At minimum, the player can view the questsion(s), the answer choices, the correct answer upon submission, and their score. It could be a user interface (UI), command line tool, etc. Feel free to use whatever framework or language you are comfortable with.

## Issues and Future Implementations
This was definitely a unique challenge! Having to think about all the pieces that makes a trivia challenge unique like nonpredictable answer choices and clearly labeling correct and incorrect answers was definitely the highlight of this challenge. I tried to go for a slightly stylized look, future implementaions would add more congruent design patterns and interesting UI features. I had hoped to implement a timer feature and question complexity feature, but I ran out of time before the due date of the challenge.
