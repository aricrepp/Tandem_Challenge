Tandom 2020 Code Challenge


##The Challenge
Your goal is to create an application that displays trivia questions with multiple choice answers to select from.
Use creative license in terms of how you want us to see this game. At minimum, the player can view the questsion(s), the answer choices, the correct answer upon submission, and their score. It could be a user interface (UI), command line tool, etc. Feel free to use whatever framework or language you are comfortable with.
